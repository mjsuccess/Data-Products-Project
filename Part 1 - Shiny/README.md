# Part 1: The Application

In this easy to use application you are shown a plot of empty circles and asked to guess the number of circles. You use a slider that ensures you are able to limit your guesses to the range of the problem. You are simply required to slide the bar to the number you believer represents how many circles there are and click 'submit'.

# Part 2: The Presentation

To support the application created in this project, a short pitch has been created in Rstudio Presenter. Although not neccesary to the operation of the application, it is advised that this presentation be skimmed.
